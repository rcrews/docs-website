The Workload Manager Service provides you with the tools you need to
gain an in-depth understanding of your workloads. The Telemetry
Publisher sends information to Workload Manager that allows you to view
relevant statistics about your jobs and information that you can use to
troubleshoot failed jobs and optimize slow jobs. Workload Manager can
auto-generate workload views for you, or you can manually define views
based on information that is important to you, such as a specific
database, statement type, or user.
