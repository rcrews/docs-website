Apache HDFS is a Java-based file system for storing large volumes of
data. Designed to span large clusters of commodity servers, HDFS
provides scalable and reliable data storage.

Apache YARN is the processing layer for managing distributed
applications that run on multiple machines in a network. YARN allows you
to use various data processing engines for batch, interactive, and
real-time stream processing of data stored in HDFS.

HDFS and YARN form the data management layer of Apache Hadoop. YARN
provides the resource management while HDFS provides the storage.
