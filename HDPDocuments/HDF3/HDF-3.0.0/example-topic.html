    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">To build real-world data in motion apps such as those based on the Internet of Things
       (IoT), you need both flow management and stream processing capabilities. What is the
       difference between the two?</p>
       <p class="p">Data in motion apps typically have the following key requirements:</p>
       <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Acquisition of Data</strong> from data sources within the data
         center, and across cloud environments and edge devices.</p>

             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Moving and Filtering of Data</strong> from edge devices (such as
         telematic panels on trucks), and across cloud environments and core data centers.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Intelligent and Dynamic Routing of Data</strong> across regional
         data centers to core processing data centers.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Delivering Data</strong> to different downstream systems.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Joining and Splitting Streams of Data</strong> as they
         move.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Detecting complex patterns</strong> in the streams of
         data.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Scoring/Executing Analytics Models</strong> within the
         stream.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
             <p class="p">
                <strong class="ph b bold">Creating Custom Dashboards</strong> to visualize and analyze the
         streams and insights.</p>
          </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="p">To explain how flow management and stream processing relate to these requirements, we employ
     a fictitious use case for trucking company X, which installed sensors on its fleet of trucks.
     These sensors emit streams of event data such as speed, braking frequency, and geo-code
     location. In this use case, the trucking company is building an IoT trucking app that monitors
     trucks in real time.</p>
       <p class="p">The following diagram illustrates how each of these requirements would be implemented in the
     context of stream processing and flow management:</p>
       <p class="p">

       </p>
       <p class="p">As part of the stream processing suite available in HDF, Streaming Analytics Manager
     provides capabilities for implementing the requirements outlined in blue in the previous
     diagram.</p>
       <p class="p">To summarize, Streaming Analytics Manager provides the following core capabilities:</p>
