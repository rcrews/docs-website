OVERVIEW
Items appearing in the following notices are provided for the notification and guidance of the recipient in accordance with the listed license.  The listing may include various dependencies applicable only to development, testing, and evaluation, which may not be included in the distribution and may have been deprecated in favor of alternatives.  Accordingly, this listing should not be construed as an admission that the listed component appears in the distribution nor in the manner indicated.  Similarly, fulfilling a license's compliance requirements for a particular form of distribution is not an admission that the software is in fact distributed in that form.  Distributions and packaging vary and not all third party components are relied upon in the same manner or degree.  In addition, some compliance documentation, such as embedded notices files in source code, may be found within the distribution itself rather than below.  "Third Party Software" and "Separately Licensed Code" as defined in the applicable Cloudera or Hortonworks agreement, respectively, have the same meaning for the purposes of this notice.

MOST PERMISSIVE LICENSE APPLIES TO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE
Where the Third Party Software contains dual or multiple licensing options, the most permissive license compatible with your Cloudera software license applies.

CONTAINERIZED OPERATING SYSTEM
The Cloudera software runs on certain operating systems, such as the Linux operating system, which may be delivered to you with a containerized installation of the operating system for your convenience. Cloudera software constitutes a separate and independent work from the operating system, and the provided container is an aggregation of the operating system and the Cloudera software.

NO WARRANTY; NO LIABILITY; NO INDEMNIFICATION/HOLD HARMLESS
Notwithstanding any agreement recipient may have with Cloudera: (A) CLOUDERA PROVIDES THRID PARTY SOFTWARE TO RECIPIENT WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND; (B) CLOUDERA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (C) CLOUDERA IS NOT LIABLE TO RECIPIENT, AND WILL NOT DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, NOR HOLD RECIPIENT HARMLESS FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE; AND (D) WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, CLOUDERA IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES RELATED TO LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF INCOME, LOSS OF BUSINESS ADVANTAGE OR UNAVAILABILITY, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA.

SOURCE CODE OFFER
To the extent required by the licenses associated with the Third Party Software, Cloudera, Inc. will provide a copy of the Third Party Software's source code upon request and at a reasonable fee.  All requests for source code should be made in a letter clearly identifying the components for which the source code is requested, and mailed to "Cloudera, Inc., ATTN: Legal Dept., 395 Page Mill Rd Palo Alto, CA 94306".

Further, to the extent Cloudera delivers a containerized installation of an operating system, such operating system contains open source software constituting Third Party Software, including software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Such Third Party Software may or may not be identified separately in the notices below.  To the extent required by the GPL or other licenses associated with the Third Party Software under which you receive only binaries, Cloudera will provide a copy of the Third Party Software's source code upon request and at a reasonable fee.  All requests for source code should be made in a letter clearly identifying the components for which the source code is requested, typically sent within three (3) years from the date you received the covered binary, and mailed to "Cloudera, Inc., ATTN: Legal Dept., 395 Page Mill Rd Palo Alto, CA 94306"  Your written request should include: (i) the name and version number of the covered binary, (ii) the version number of the Cloudera product containing the covered binary, (iii) your name, (iv) your company or organization name (if applicable), (v) the license under which the source code must be provided, and (vi) your return mailing and email address (if available).

shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

Artistic License 2.0
(isaacs's npm 6.1.0)

Artistic License 2.0
====================

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.


Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may
be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the
Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that
Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you
should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.


Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the
Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify
the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist
of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to
anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of
your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or
providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing
fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been
modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes
were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard
Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The
Perl Foundation in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other
form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.


Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified
Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute
the Modified Version.


Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version
of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a
Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright
notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may
or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be
considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original
License.


Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a
Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version,
including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features,
executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard
Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include
your modifications in the Standard Version.
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user
installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version
must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source
form of the Modified Version available to others under
(i) the Original License or
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute
the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that
the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version,
and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees
are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source

(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source,
provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the
Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your
distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such
distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or
cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease
distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are
invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the
Modified Version.


Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided
that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are
permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are
permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the
Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to
embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or
bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the
result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct
interface to the Package.


Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend
or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a
Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package
itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.


General Provisions

(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the
Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package,
if you do not accept this license.

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by
someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your
Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service
mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the
Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute
patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party
alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such
litigation is filed.

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND
CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS
REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

      infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by
      that Contributor.

  3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
    Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
    You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
    form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.
    You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
    exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
    by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
    Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
    rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You
    as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
    copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
    Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
    attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
    Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
    or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge
    a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
    more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your
    own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result
    of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
    terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which
    may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
    Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
    in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
    distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
    license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as
    a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
    this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

  4.  Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
    revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
    Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
    this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
    which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
    Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
    being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
    of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
    under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
    received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms
    of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
    Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
    License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the
    name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from
    this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains
    terms which differ from this License.

  5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
  DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
  UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

  6.  TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
    shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
    Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to
    as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly
    or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
    Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
    such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw
    Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
    Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
    Participant.

    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
    distributor) shall survive termination.

  7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
  IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  8.  U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
  software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

  9.  MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export
  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
  otherwise make available any Covered Software.

  10.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
    Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
    You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You
    as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
    copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software,

    Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
    form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
    recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own

    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
    other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which
    You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer
    includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
    distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the
    License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
    Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
    License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name
    of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this
    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms
    which differ from this License.


  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
  DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
  UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.



  6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
    shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
    Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
    "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial
    Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1
    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
    terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
    notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim
    with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
    that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent
    where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
    the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
    license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
    distributor) shall survive termination.


  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. S 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
  software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.



  9. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export
  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
  otherwise make available any Covered Software.



  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

  a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
    encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
    with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
    works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
    defined below) for the purposes of this License.

  b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
    dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
    reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work
    may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
    Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

  c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
    terms of this License.

  d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

  e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
    this License.

  f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
    rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

  a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
    Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

  c.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the
    Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

  d.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
    Derivative Works.

  e.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

      i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
        rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
        performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

      ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
        agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
        phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
        subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
        Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

  f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where
    the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
    collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
    SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
    of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
    of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
    include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
    every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
    recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
    the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
    the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
    technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
    inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
    the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
    Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
    this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
    credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative
    Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as
    requested.

  b.  If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You
    must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author
    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
    publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
    parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
    practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies
    to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a
    Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative
    Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
    "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
    a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear
    where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least
    as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

  a.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
    who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

  b.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

  a.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.

  b.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  c.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  e.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
    representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
    not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.

in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any
party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without

Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED
TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
    in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
    of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
    other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,

    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
    not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
    License.

  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including,
    at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same
    purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
    (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made
    available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.

  d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies

    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
    broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

  h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
    this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
    scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
    expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other

    work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
    engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
    illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
    geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
    phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
    copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to

  i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
    rights under this License despite a previous violation.

  j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
    communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
    including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
    available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
    access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
    to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the
    communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by
    public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
    means including signs, sounds or images.

  k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
    limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
    reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
    performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
    and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
    Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
    translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
    original work has been modified.";

  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,

  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

  e.

    For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
        right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
        granted under this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
        under this License; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
        under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
    License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
    terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
    Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
    require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
    terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
    credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
    4(c), as requested.

  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv)
    a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
    one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
    mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
    with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following
    provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable
    License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
    restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient
    of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
    terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
    every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
    Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
    Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from
    You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
    from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
    License.

  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
    Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
    Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
    a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
    for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
    part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
    may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
    sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
    the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
    must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
    Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
    License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
    otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
    7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
    representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
    not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
    were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
    Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
    the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
    Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Eclipse Public License 1.0
(AspectJ weaver 1.8.13, H2 Database Engine 1.4.197, Javax Persistence API 2.0 2.1.0, loopremover-impl 0.7.4)

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and
sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such
as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after
the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

(Aopalliance Version 1.0 Repackaged As A Module 2.6.1)

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.


1. DEFINITIONS
--------------

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed
  under this Agreement, and
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

    i) changes to the Program, and
    ii) additions to the Program;

  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
  Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a
  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
  acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or
  additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any
Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form,
that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial
revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results
from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the
Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that
contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that
contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of
the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass
the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any
manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and
configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or
any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional
permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
  such Derivative Works.
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
  Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
  transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other
  form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution
  and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
  to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
  Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
  license before distributing the Program.
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
  copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
  set forth in this Agreement.
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes
  additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this
  Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the
  terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).


3. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  this Agreement, provided that such license:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties
    and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
    title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;

    (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
    available under a Secondary License, and
    (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described
    in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under
    the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,
attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability
('notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they
Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.


4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify

and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such

Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial

APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.


6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
--------------------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


7. GENERAL
----------

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing

subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a
Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under
this Agreement.


Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
---------------------------------------------

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary
Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse
Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not
  sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
  then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
  relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
  notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

      [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts

      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence

      the version number 2.1.]


Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by
problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore
permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other
code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.
To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more
frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
      third parties under the terms of this License.

      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
      the square root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
      based on the Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
      this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
must do one of these things:

      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
      definitions.)

      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
      made with.

      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for
      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
      that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

      Copyright (C) year name of author

      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public

      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU

      Lesser General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public

      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

      by James Random Hacker.

      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

      Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

  world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
  intellectual property claims:

    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
    sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
    without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
    Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale,
    and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).



    (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
    date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of
    this License.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)
    for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the

    Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software
    or devices.

  2.2. Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims,
  each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license

      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
    sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
    portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
    Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
    Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination
    with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use,
    sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)

    Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part
    of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
    infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that
    Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
  contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
  distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
  License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
  with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
  any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
  version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
  include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
  Section 3.5.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
  You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
  this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
  accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date
  it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
  version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
  remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
  by a third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
  contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
  that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
  provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
  Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
  version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
  of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

    (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
    third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
    include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
    describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that
    a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
    after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
    Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
    makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
    those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
    programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
    this information in the LEGAL file.

            (c)    Representations.

    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
    above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
    Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights conveyed by this License.


  3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
  of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
  Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
  for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
  name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
  describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You
  may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
  Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
  that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
  Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
  Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
  Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
  choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
  Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
  the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
  distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
  terms You offer.

  3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
  with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
  maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
  affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
  Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
  be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
  notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

  6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may
  publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
  version will be given a distinguishing version number.

  6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
  particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
  terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
  terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
  other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
  Code created under this License.

  6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
  (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
  Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
  that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
  ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
  to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
  clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
  Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
  License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION.

  8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
  Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive.

  8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
  action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

  (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
  notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
  agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
  by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
  Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a
  reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
  writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
  terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

  (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
  Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
  rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
  revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or
  had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

  8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
  that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
  prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
  value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
  shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
  or license.

  8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end
  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR
ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
  2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
  ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
  the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
  subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
  party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
  Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits
  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the
  alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
  described in Exhibit A.

  license:

    a.

      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,

  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
  such Contribution.


  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    a.

      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b.

      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

    c.

      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
      Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
  requirements in Section 3.4).


  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute

  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
  terms of Section 3.3).


  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
  Contributions conveyed by this License.


  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
  Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities
-------------------


  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.


  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    a.

      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b.

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

            a separate license.

          f.  You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or

          i.  Software may contain programs that perform automated collection of
            system data and/or automated software updating services. System data

        The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your
        rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
        from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of
        Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this
        Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion
        likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property
        infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will
        cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to
        Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the
        Agreement.

      7.  Java Compatibility and Open Source.

        Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional
        classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
        compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
        at www.java.net.

        Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
        developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
        open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
        products.

        Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
        open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
        the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
        alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
        licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
        provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this
        distribution.

      8.  Limited Warranty.

        Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
        purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
        Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and
        workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is
        provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
        this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media
        or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations
        on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This
        limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,
        which vary from state to state.

      9.  Disclaimer of Warranty.

        UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
        DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE
        LEGALLY INVALID.

      10.  Limitation of Liability.

        TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
        LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
        INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
        REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
        USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you,
        whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
        the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
        limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
        essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
        or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
        applicable to you.

      11.  Export Regulations.

        All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
        delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
        and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
        You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
        acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
        export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

      12.  U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

        If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
        by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
        then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
        will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
        48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
        acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
        acquisitions).

      13.  Governing Law.

        Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law
        and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
        jurisdiction will apply.

      14.  Severability.

        If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
        Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
        omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
        Agreement will immediately terminate.

      15.  Integration.

        This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the
        entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It
        supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,
        proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any
        conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
        other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
        during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will
        be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative
        of each party.

        Entitlement may be provided in your receipt, invoice or your contract
        with Sun or authorized Sun reseller. It may also be in electronic format
        if you download Software.

      3.  Permitted Use.

        As selected in your Entitlement, one or more of the following Permitted
        Uses will apply to your use of Software. Unless you have an Entitlement
        that expressly permits it, you may not use Software for any of the other
        Permitted Uses. If you don't have an Entitlement, or if your Entitlement
        doesn't cover additional software delivered to you, then such software is
        for your Evaluation Use. (a) Evaluation Use. You may evaluate Software
        internally for a period of 90 days from your first use. (b) Research and
        Instructional Use. You may use Software internally to design, develop and

      4.  Licensed Units.

        Your Permitted Use is limited to the number of Licensed Units stated in
        your Entitlement. If you require additional Licensed Units, you will need
        additional Entitlement(s).

      5.  Restrictions.

          a.  The copies of Software provided to you under this Agreement are
            licensed, not sold, to you by Sun. Sun reserves all rights not
            expressly granted.

          b.  You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may
            not copy, modify, or distribute Software. However if the Sun
            documentation accompanying Software lists specific portions of
            Software, such as header files, class libraries, reference source
            code, and/or redistributable files, that may be handled differently,
            you may do so only as provided in the Sun documentation.

          c.  You may not rent, lease, lend or encumber Software.

          d. Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not
            decompile, or reverse engineer Software.

          e.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any
            Software updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace
            and/or supplement the original Software, unless such update contains
            a separate license.

          f.  You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or
            comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior
            written consent of Sun.

          g.  Software is confidential and copyrighted.

          h.  Unless otherwise specified, if Software is delivered with embedded
            or bundled software that enables functionality of Software, you may
            not use such software on a stand-alone basis or use any portion of
            such software to interoperate with any program(s) other than
            Software.

          i.  Software may contain programs that perform automated collection of
            system data and/or automated software updating services. System data
            collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its
            subcontractors, and its service delivery partners for the purpose of
            providing you with remote system services and/or improving Sun's
            software and systems.

          j.  Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the
            design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear
            facility and Sun and its licensors disclaim any express or implied
            warranty of fitness for such uses.

          k.  No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark,
            logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this
            Agreement.

      6.  Term and Termination.

        The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your
        rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
        from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of
        Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this
        Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion
        likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property
        infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will
        cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to
        Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the
        Agreement.

      7.  Java Compatibility and Open Source.

        Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional
        classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
        compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
        at www.java.net.

        Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
        developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
        open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
        products.

        Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
        open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
        the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
        alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
        licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
        provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this
        distribution.

      8.  Limited Warranty.

        Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
        purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
        Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and
        workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is
        provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
        this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media
        or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations
        on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This
        limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,
        which vary from state to state.

      9.  Disclaimer of Warranty.

        UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
        DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE
        LEGALLY INVALID.

      10.  Limitation of Liability.

        TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
        LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
        INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
        REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
        USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you,
        whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
        the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
        limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
        essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
        or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
        applicable to you.

      11.  Export Regulations.

        All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
        delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
        and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
        You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
        acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
        export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

      12.  U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

        If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
        by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
        then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
        will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
        48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
        acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
        acquisitions).

      13.  Governing Law.

        Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law
        and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
        jurisdiction will apply.

      14.  Severability.

        If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
        Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
        omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
        Agreement will immediately terminate.

      15.  Integration.

        This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the
        entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It
        supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,
        proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any
        conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
        other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
        during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will
        be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative
        of each party.
