============================================================================== 

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, known issues, and 
workflow changes in Cloudera ODBC Driver for Impala 2.6.10, as well as the 
version history. 

For information about upcoming support deprecations or removals, see the 
Workflow Changes section. Deprecated features will not receive any updates,
but will continue to be usable in their current state until support is 
removed in a future release.


2.6.10 =======================================================================

Released 2020-03-27

Enhancements & New Features

 * [IMP-656] Updated default value for DisableOptimizedEncodingConverter

    The DisableOptimizedEncodingConvert property is now set to false by 
    default. For more information, see the Installation and Configuration 
    Guide.

 * [IMP-700] Updated CDH support

   The driver now supports CDH versions 5.11 through 5.16 and 6.0 through 6.3.

 * [IMP-752] Support for notarization

   The driver now supports notarization on macOS systems, enabling it to be 
   run on macOS versions 10.14.6 and later.

 * [IMP-769] Updated boost library on AIX

   The AIX version of the driver now uses boost version 1.59.0. Previously, 
   the AIX version of the driver used version 1.55.0.


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Cloudera ODBC Driver for Impala 
2.6.10.

 * [IMP-661] If the server returns invalid UTF-8 characters, the driver 
   throws an exception. In some cases, this causes exceptionally slow 
   performance in certain BI tools.

   This issue has been resolved. The driver now replaces the invalid UTF-8 
   characters.

 * [IMP-705][00174966] If the driver calls SQLColumns on a column whose data 
   type name is longer than 128 bytes, it throws a memory management error.

 * [IMP-768] The driver exports third-party symbols that, in some cases, 
   cause conflicts with applications

   This issue has been resolved. The driver now hides all third-party symbols.

 * [IMP-770][00177089] In some cases, the driver does not log a connection 
   error.


Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in 
the data source, the driver, or an application.

 * Limited support for BINARY, DATE, and TIME data types

   - BINARY is not a supported data type in Impala.
   - DATE is supported only when you connect to Impala version 3.3 or later.
   - As a result of the limitations above, some values of TIME data types are
     also not supported.


Workflow Changes =============================================================

The following changes may disrupt established workflows for the driver.

In addition to changes that are already implemented in the current version of 
the driver, this section describes potentially disruptive changes that will 
be implemented in a future version of the driver, so that you can plan 
accordingly.

2.6.8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * [IMP-680] Removed support for earlier versions of Impala and CDH

   Beginning with this release, the driver no longer supports Impala 1.0.1 to
   2.6 and CDH 5.0 to 5.8. For a list of supported versions, see the

2.6.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Minimum TLS Version

   Beginning with this release, the driver requires a minimum version of TLS 
   for encrypting the data store connection. By default, the driver requires 
   TLS version 1.2. This requirement may cause existing DSNs and connection 
   strings to stop working, if they are used to connect to data stores that 
   use a TLS version earlier than 1.2.

   To resolve this, in your DSN or connection string, set the Minimum TLS 
   option (the Min_TLS property) to the appropriate version of TLS for your 
   server. For more information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

   query" error.

 * [IMP-724] The driver terminates unexpectedly when both of the following 
   occur: 
   - Multiple database drivers are loaded to the same process. 
   - One driver unloads and calls ICU's u_cleanup() function, while another 
     driver continues to run and tries to access the memory space that has 
     been cleaned up.

   text.

 * [IMP-677] New name for Enable Simulated Transactions

   The configuration option Enable Simulated Transactions (key name 
   EnableSimulatedTransactions) has been renamed to Ignore Transactions (key 
   name IgnoreTransactions). The previous key name continues to be supported 
   for backwards compatibility.

 * [IMP-671] Updated third-party library linking for Linux
 
   In the Linux driver, minor internal improvements have been implemented for 
   the linking between the third-party libraries and the main driver library.

   when a transport or communication link failure occurs.

 * [00144299][IMP-660] When you insert a negative value into a TINYINT 
   column, the driver returns an error.

   always returned.

 * [IMP-670] When retrieving a DECIMAL value that contains an integer ending 
   with 0, the driver erroneously returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO and a 
   truncation error.

   DECIMAL data correctly. 
   
 * [IMP-612] The driver does not pass a UID into the session when connected 
   using No Authentication.

 * [IMP-631] When inserting CHAR or VARCHAR values, the driver incorrectly 
   translates those values to CAST(CAST(...)).

   been changed to keytab.
      
 * [IMP-520] Linux installation workflow improvement
 
   A single set of RPMs now work for all supported Linux distributions.
