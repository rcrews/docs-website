Enhancements & New Features

 * [00176863][HIVEJ-584] Updated Thrift library

   0.12.0.

 * [HIVEJ-575] Updated Jackson library

   The driver now uses version 2.10.1 of the Jackson library. Previously, the 
   driver used Jackson version 2.9.9.


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Cloudera JDBC Driver for Apache 
Hive 2.6.10.

 * [HIVEJ-577] The JDBC 4.1 version of the driver fails to connect to servers 
   that require encryption using TLS 1.2.

 * [HIVEJ-578] When you invoke the JDBC 4.2 driver with the Datasource class, 
   an exception occurs.

 * [00176503][HIVEJ-583] When you use the driver with the Denodo application, 
   it returns the following error: "Could not initialize Class".

 * [HIVEJ-596] In some cases, Hive queries fail with the following error: 
   "com.cloudera.hiveserver2.exceptions.ExceptionConverter.toSQLException: [JDBC Driver]Index: 4, Size: 4"

 * [HIVEJ-597] SQL statements using the EXISTS predicate return an error.

 * [HIVEJ-599] The driver returns incorrect results for decimal columns.


Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in 
the data source, the driver, or an application.

 * [HIVEJ-577] The JDBC 4.0 version of the driver fails to connect to servers 
   that require encryption using TLS 1.1 or later.

   When you attempt to connect to the server, the connection fails and the 
   driver returns an SSL handshake exception. This issue occurs only when you 
   run the driver using Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6.0.

   As a workaround, run the driver using JRE 7.0 or 8.0.


Workflow Changes =============================================================

Resolved Issues
The following issue was resolved in Cloudera JDBC Driver for Apache Hive 
2.6.2.

 * The driver does not behave according to the SocketTimeout setting, and
   stops responding instead of returning an  error when the server takes too
   long to respond to a request.
   
   This issue has been resolved. The driver now returns an error if the amount
   of time taken by the server to respond to a request exceeds the number of
   seconds specified by the SocketTimeout setting.


2.6.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2018-04-27

Resolved Issues
The following issues were resolved in Cloudera JDBC Driver for Apache Hive 
2.6.1.

 * [00115543] A string literal after a back-tick ( ` ) is treated as a 
   comment.

 * [00115424] When the driver attempts to connect to the server using 
   Beeline, an error occurs on the server and an exception is logged by the 
   driver. 

   This issue has been resolved. Now, when connecting to the server using 
   Beeline, connection properties such as "driver" and "url" are no longer 
   treated as configuration properties for the server, and the driver does 
   not send SET queries to the server with these properties.

 * [00114906] The driver removes query comments and hints when the 
   UseNativeQuery property is set to 1.
