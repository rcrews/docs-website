Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) is a secure and governed cloud service
platform that offers a broad set of enterprise data cloud services with
the key data analytics and artificial intelligence functionality that
enterprises require.

Addressing real-world business problems generally requires the
application of multiple analytic functions working together on the same
data; For example, autonomous vehicles require the application of both
real-time data streaming and machine learning algorithms. CDP addresses
this by offering multi-function data management and analytics that allow
solving an enterpriseâ€™s most pressing data and analytic challenges in a
streamlined fashion.

CDP consists of the following services:

* [Management Console](/management-console/cloud/index.html)
* [Workload Manager](/workload-manager/cloud/index.html)
* [Data Catalog](/data-catalog/cloud/index.html)
