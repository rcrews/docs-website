Cloudera Manager is an application you use to manage, configure, and
monitor CDP Data Center clusters and Cloudera Runtime services.

The Cloudera Manager server runs on a host in your CDP Data Center
deployment and manages your clusters using Cloudera Manager Agents that
run on each host in the cluster.

The Cloudera Manager Admin Console is a web application administrators
and others can use to manage a CDP Data Center deployment. Using the
Cloudera Manager Admin Console, you can start and stop the cluster and
individual services, add new services, manage security, and upgrade the
cluster.

You access the Cloudera Manager Admin Console using a Web browser. You
can also use the Cloudera Manager API to programatically perform
management tasks.
