Cloudera Streaming Analytics powered by Apache Flink offers a framework
for real-time stream processing and streaming analytics. Connected with
Apache Kafka, CSA provides monitoring and logging solutions as Schema Registry,
Streams Messaging Manager and Kafka Metrics Reporter.

Before you begin developing streaming applications with Flink, Cloudera
recommends reviewing the Flink Application Tutorials. These learning
guides walk you through the basic steps to build a Flink
application from scratch.

For newcomers to Flink:
- Simple Flink Application Tutorial: a self-contained alerting application establishing basic Flink best practices

For advanced users:
- Secured Flink Application Tutorial: an application demonstrating Flink security features
- Stateful Flink Application Tutorial: a stateful inventory management service focusing on production grade development and operation requirements

See the tutorials and the corresponding reference Flink applications
