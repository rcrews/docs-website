Cloudera Streaming Analytics powered by Apache Flink offers a framework
for real-time stream processing and streaming analytics. Connected with
Apache Kafka, CSA provides monitoring and logging solutions as Schema Registry,
Streams Messaging Manager and Kafka Metrics Reporter.

Before you begin developing streaming applications with Flink, Cloudera
recommends reviewing the Flink Application Tutorials. These learning
guides walk you through the basic steps to build a Flink
application from scratch.

For newcomers to Flink:
- Simple Flink Application Tutorial: a warning and alert application
  with a basic Flink structure

For advanced users:
- Secured Flink Application Tutorial: enabling security features for a Flink
  application
- Stateful Flink Application Tutorial: a real-time management service
  with a stateful Flink application

See the tutorials and the corresponding reference Flink applications
