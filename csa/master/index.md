Cloudera Streaming Analytics powered by Apache Flink offers a framework
for real-time stream processing and streaming analytics. Connected with
Kafka, CSA provides monitoring and logging solutions as Schema Registry,
Streams Messaging Manager and Kafka Metrics Reporter.

Before you begin developing streaming applications with Flink, Cloudera recommends reviewing the Flink Application Tutorials. The learning guides will walk you through the basic steps to build a Flink application from scratch.
For newcomers to Flink:
- Simple Flink Application Tutorial: a warning and alert application with a basic Flink structure
For advanced users:
- Secured Flink Application Tutorial: security steps for a Flink application
- Stateful Flink Application Tutorial: a real-time management service with a stateful Flink application

You can find the corresponding code repository for the tutorials [here](https://github.com/cloudera/flink-tutorials).
