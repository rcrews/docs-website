Data Catalog is a service within Cloudera Data Platform that enables you
to understand, manage, secure, and govern data assets across the
enterprise. Data Catalog helps you understand data across multiple
clusters and across multiple CDP environments. You can search to locate
relevant data of interest based on various parameters. Using Data
Catalog, you can understand how data is interpreted for use, how it is
created and modified, and how data access is secured and protected.
