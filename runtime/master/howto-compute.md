Apache YARN manages resources for the applications running on your
cluster by allocating resources through scheduling,  limiting CPU usage,
and partitioning clusters. You can use Access Control Lists to use YARN
with a secure cluster. By using Apache YARN, you can optimize the use of
vcores and memory.
