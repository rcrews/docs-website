Apache Atlas provides data governance capabilities for your Cloudera
Data Platform (CDP). Apache Atlas serves as a common metadata store
that is designed to collect and store metadata, show relationships
among metadata entities, and give you a place to add your own
information to document business processes.
Close integration
of Atlas with Apache Ranger enables you to define, administer, and
manage security and compliance policies consistently across all
components of CDP. Atlas also provides metadata and lineage to
Data Catalog to support curating data across enterprise data.
