Apache Atlas provides data governance capabilities for Hadoop. Apache
Atlas serves as a common metadata store that is designed to exchange
metadata both within and outside of the Hadoop stack. Close integration
of Atlas with Apache Ranger enables you to define, administer, and
manage security and compliance policies consistently across all
components of the Hadoop stack. Atlas provides metadata and lineage to
Data Steward Studio to support curating data across enterprise data.
