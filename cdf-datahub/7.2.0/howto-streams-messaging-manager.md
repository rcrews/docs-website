      Describes how you can use Streams Messaging Manager to monitor
      end-to-end latency in topics. Use the latency feature to
      verify whether consumers are consuming the messages produced in a
      topic within the time SLA, identify the slow consuming
      applications that might occur due to an external or process
      bottleneck, and verify whether the consumers are consuming
      all the messages.

Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) is an operations monitoring and management tool that provides end-to-end visibility in an enterprise Apache Kafka environment. With SMM, you can gain clear insights about your Kafka clusters, understand the end-to-end flow of message streams from producers to topics to consumers and analyze the stream dynamics between producers and consumers using various filters. SMM also helps you troubleshoot your Kafka environment to identify bottlenecks, throughputs, consumer patterns, and traffic flow.
