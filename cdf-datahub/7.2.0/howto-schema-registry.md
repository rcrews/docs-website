Schema Registry provides a shared repository of schemas that allows applications to flexibly interact with each other. Applications frequently need a way to share metadata across data format, schema, and semantics. Schema Registry addresses these challenges by evolving schemas such that a producer and consumer can understand different versions of the schemas but still read all information shared between both versions and safely ignore the rest.
