      Describes how you can use Streams Messaging Manager to monitor
      end-to-end latency in topics. Use the latency feature to
      verify whether consumers are consuming the messages produced in a
      topic within the time SLA, identify the slow consuming
      applications that might occur due to an external or process
      bottleneck, and verify whether the consumers are consuming
      all the messages.
