On November 22, 2019, we released
[CDP Data Center](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform/cdp-data-center.html),
our next-generation on-premises offering,
representing the strongest elements of the former Cloudera and
Hortonworks platforms accompanied by new innovations for better
scalability, performance and private cloud readiness.

Relative to Cloudera’s Enterprise Data Hub, CDP Data Center now offers:

* Better **security**: attribute-based, fine-grained access controls
  featuring dynamic row filtering and column masking with Ranger.
* Better **governance**: more scalable data lineage, data discovery, and
  metadata search with Atlas 2.0.
* Better **performance**: faster Hive queries and support for ACID
  transactions.

Relative to Hortonworks Data Platform, CDP Data Center brings:

* Better **management**: manage multiple clusters from one control
  plane, one-click wire encryption, and streamlined maintenance operations
  with Cloudera Manager.
* Better **SQL analytics**: low-latency interactive SQL with Impala,
  Kudu, and Hue.
* Better **encryption**: enterprise-grade cryptographic key storage with
  Key Trustee Server.

And for all our customers, CDP Data Center provides the foundation
(storage and SDX) for our upcoming CDP Private applications.
