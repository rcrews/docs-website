Cloudera Data Platform - Data Center is a secure and governed on-premise
platform that offers a broad set of enterprise data cloud services with
the key data analytics and artificial intelligence functionality that

application of multiple analytic functions working together on the same
data; For example, autonomous vehicles require the application of both
real-time data streaming and machine learning algorithms. CDP Data Center addresses
this by offering multi-function data management and analytics that allow
solving an enterpriseâ€™s most pressing data and analytic challenges in a
streamlined fashion.
