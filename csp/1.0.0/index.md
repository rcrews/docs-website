This is the 2.0.0 content, and will be replaced with 1.0.0 content when available.

Cloudera Stream Processing (CSP) provides advanced messaging, stream
processing and analytics capabilities powered by Apache Kafka as the
core stream processing engine. It also provides streams management
capabilities. Two streams management services have been added for Kafka
monitoring and replication. Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) provides a
single monitoring dashboard for a Kafka cluster. Streams Replication
Manager (SRM) provides enterprises with the ability to implement
cross-cluster Kafka topic replication.
