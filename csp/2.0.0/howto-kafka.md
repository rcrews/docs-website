Apache Kafka is a distributed commit log service that functions much like a publish/subscribe messaging system, but with better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault tolerance. Kafka provides the following:

- Persistent messaging with O(1) disk structures that provide constant time performance, even with terabytes of stored messages.
- High throughput, supporting hundreds of thousands of messages per second, even with modest hardware.
- Explicit support for partitioning messages over Kafka servers and distributing consumption over a cluster of consumer machines while maintaining per-partition ordering semantics.
- Support for parallel data load into Hadoop.
